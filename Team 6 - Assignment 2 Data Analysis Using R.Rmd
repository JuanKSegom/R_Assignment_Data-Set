## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

The source data and this RMD file are in the next link: https://github.com/JuanKSegom/R_Assignment_Data-Set

```{r code}
mydata <- read.csv('train.csv')

#Structure of the data set
str(mydata) 

#Listing the variables of data set can use ls(mydata) as well  
names(mydata)

#top 15 records
head(mydata, 15) 

#user defined function
house_Age <- function(x){  
  
  a = 2022
  b= mydata$YrSold 
  c=mydata$SalePrice
  d = a - b
  
  
  paste("The house age in years is", d, "it was purchased in the year ", mydata$YrSold)
  
}
house_Age()

# Extract rows where Neigborhood is Timber and Sale Price is between 150000 and 250000
filter(mydata,Neighborhood == "Timber",between(SalePrice,150000,250000)) 

# The Sale Price variable is dependent on the Overall Quality and Condition of the house. This code creates a data frame by joining these variables.
mydata.df = cbind(mydata$OverallQual,mydata$OverallCond,mydata$SalePrice)
View(mydata.df)
mydata.df = as.data.frame(mydata.df)
names(mydata.df)[1]="OverallQual"
names(mydata.df)[2]="OverallCond"
names(mydata.df)[3]="SalePrice"
mydata.df

# Remove missing values in your dataset.
is.na(mydata)
na.omit(mydata)

# Identify and remove duplicated data in your dataset
duplicated(mydata)
sum(duplicated(mydata))
mydata[!duplicated(mydata), ]

# Reorder multiple rows in descending order
arrange(mydata, -LotArea,-LotFrontage)

# Rename columns Street, Condition1 and Condition2
mydata<-mydata %>%
  rename(
    NewStreet=Street,
    ConditionA=Condition1,
    ConditionB=Condition2
  )
mydata

# Create a new column YearsToRemd with the difference in years from built to
# remodeled
mydata<-mydata %>%
  mutate(
    YearsToRemod = YearRemodAdd - YearBuilt
  )
mydata

# Selects 65% of the rows from our working dataset to create a new training set
ramD = sort(sample(nrow(mydata), nrow(mydata)*.65))
tset<-mydata[ramD,]
tset

#summary statistics
summary(mydata) 

##scatterplot 

mean(mydata$LotArea)
median(mydata$SalePrice)
mode(mydata$SalePrice)
range(mydata$SalePrice)
mean(mydata$SalePrice)

cor(mydata$YrSold,mydata$SalePrice)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r plots}
plot(mydata$YrSold,mydata$SalePrice)

##BarPlot

Movies <-c(4,7,3,1,9)
barplot(Movies)

ggplot(mydata, aes(x= MSSubClass)) + geom_bar()
head(mydata)

##Correlation

y=mydata$SalePrice
x=mydata$YrSold
plot(x,y)
abline(lm(y~x))
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
